Howdy everyone, Happy Friday - it’s been a real quick first 3 weeks!
If you haven’t already seen it, we have officially chosen to use Crowdin as a tool that the community can use to directly contribute to Pelican.
We hope that this allows you to more easily share Pelican Panel with your friends and fellow cohorts.
