# Troubleshooting
## Panel errors

```sh
tail -n 100 /var/www/pelican/storage/logs/laravel-$(date +%F).log | grep "\[$(date +%Y)"
```

If the command above doesn't return anything you most likely have wrong permissions for your `storage` folder. So you first need to fix that.  
You can set the correct permissions by running `chmod -R 755 /var/www/pelican/storage/* /var/www/pelican/bootstrap/cache/`. Also make sure that your panel files are owned by the correct user.

### Some common errors

* `500 | SERVER ERROR` or `An unexpected error was encountered while processing this request` you have to check your panel logs by running the following command.
* `502 Bad Gateway Error` or some code in plain text you either didn't install php-fpm or set the wrong version in your webserver vhost.
* `sh: 1: mysql: not found`: If you are using MariaDB 11.4 or higher you'll have to restore the mysql alias by running `ln -s /usr/bin/mariadb /usr/bin/mysql`.
* `CSRF token mismatch` you are most likely using HTTP instead of HTTPS in `APP_URL` or you didn't force `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE` to false while using HTTP.
* `The MAC is invalid` make sure that your `APP_KEY` matchs your database, if its a clean install just clear it then re run `php artisan p:environment:setup`
* `ErrorException: file_put_contents(_____): failed to open stream: Permission denied`: Wrong file permissions/ ownership for the panel files, see above.
* `Connection timed out after 5001 miliseconds for _______:8080`: Your panel can't reach wings, see the wings connection issues steps below.
* `Connection refused [tcp://_______:6379]`: Redis isn't running or isn't reachable for some other reason. (start by checking the status of the redis service: `systemctl status redis-server`)
* `SSL: no alternative certificate subject name matches target host name '_______'`: The used SSL certificate for your panel isn't valid for your panel domain, see [this guide](./guides/ssl) for creating a new SSL certificate.
* `General error: 8 attempt to write a readonly database`: Your `database.sqlite` has wrong file permissions and is readonly. Make sure the file is writeable and owned by the correct user.
* `Class '_____' not found`: This usually means you are missing php extensions. Make sure [all needed extensions](./panel/getting-started#依赖项) are installed and that you are using the correct php version.

## Wings connection issues

### Check the wings service

First you should make sure that the wings service is running. To do that run `systemctl status wings`.  
It should say that the service is active and running. If its in a failed state run `sudo wings diagnostics` to check the wings logs for errors.

Some common errors in the wings logs are:

* `open /etc/letsencrypt/live/_____________/fullchain.pem: no such file or directory`: The SSL certificate for wings is missing, see [this guide](./guides/ssl) for creating a SSL certificate.
* `Pool overlaps with other one on this address space`: You already have a docker network using the default subnet. (`172.18.0.0/16`) Change the subnet in your wings config file and use `systemctl stop wings && docker network rm pelican_nw && systemctl start wings` to apply the change.
* `Error response from Panel: AccessDeniedHttpException: You are not authorized to access this resource. (HTTP/403)`: Your wings token is wrong, you need [update the token in your config.yml file](./wings/install#configure)
* `Error response from Panel: _MissingResponseCode: No error response returned from API endpoint`: Your panel is not responding correctly. This usually happens when Cloudflare is blocking the connection. In that case make sure your wings ip is added to the Cloudflare firewall. If you aren't using Cloudflare it might be some other CDN/ DDoS protection service or your provider.
* `remote: could not unmarshal response: invalid character '<' looking for beginning of value`: This is basically the same error as above: Cloudflare is blocking the connection.

### Check the wings port

If you confirmed that wings is running without errors you should make sure that the wings port (`8080` by default) isn't blocked by any firewall. The best way to check this is to use online port checkers like [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org/port-scanner.php)  
It should say "open" if you check for your node FQDN (e.g. `node.example.com` or `123.123.123.123`) and your wings port (e.g. `8080`). If it says "timed-out" you have some firewall blocking the port. This could be an internal firewall (like iptables) or an external firewall (e.g. from your provider).

### Check for NAT loop back

If your panel and wings are on the same machine or same network, and you are using domains you should check for NAT loop back issues.
Edit the `/etc/hosts` file on your panel/ wings machine and add an entry for your ip and domain.

Example:

```txt title="/etc/hosts"
123.123.123.123 panel.example.com node.example.com
```

### Check the wings connection

If you confirmed the above points you have to do some advanced troubleshooting.

Check if your panel and your browser can connect to wings.

#### Panel \<-> Wings connection

Run `curl <protocol><node fqdn>:<node port>` (e.g. `curl https://node.example.com:8080` or `curl http://123.123.123.123:8080`) on your panel machine and see what it outputs.

#### Browser \<-> Wings connection

Open `<protocol><node fqdn>:<node port>` (e.g. `https://node.example.com:8080` or `http://123.123.123.123:8080`) in your browser and see what it outputs.

In both cases it should output this when wings is reachable:
```
{"error" : "The required authorization heads were not present in the request."}
```
