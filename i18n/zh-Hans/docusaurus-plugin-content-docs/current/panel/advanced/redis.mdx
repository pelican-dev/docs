# Redis

## Install Redis

To install Redis you first need add their repository.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://packages.redis.io/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/redis-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/redis-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.redis.io/deb $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/redis.list
```

Now you can install Redis by simply running the following commands.

```sh
apt update -y
apt install -y redis-server
```

Also make sure to enable that redis will start on boot. You can do that by running the following command:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now redis-server
```

## Setup Pelican for Redis

### Use Redis as driver

Run the following commands and choose `redis` for the drivers you want. For all other options you can simply hit Enter to use the current selected values.

```sh
cd /var/www/pelican
php artisan p:environment:setup

# Clear config cache
php artisan config:clear
```

### Update Queue Listener

Next, you need to edit the queue worker file `pelican.service` in `/etc/systemd/system` to make sure the queue worker starts after redis.

The line you need to add is highlighted below.

```ini {6} title="/etc/systemd/system/pelican.service"
# Pelican Queue File
# ----------------------------------

[Unit]
Description=Pelican Queue Service
After=redis-server.service

[Service]
# On some systems the user and group might be different.
# Some systems use `apache` or `nginx` as the user and group.
User=www-data
Group=www-data
Restart=always
ExecStart=/usr/bin/php /var/www/pelican/artisan queue:work --queue=high,standard,low --tries=3
StartLimitInterval=180
StartLimitBurst=30
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

<Admonition type="info" title="Redis on Rocky Linux">
    If you are using Rocky Linux, you will need to replace `redis-server.service` with `redis.service` at the `After=` line in order to ensure `redis` starts before the queue worker.
</Admonition>

Restart the queue worker service after editing the file.

```sh
sudo systemctl restart pelican
```
