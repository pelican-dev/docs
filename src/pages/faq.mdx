            You'll receive an easy guide to migrate from Pterodactyl to Pelican.
            It will be at least as easy as upgrading was originally.

            To our knowledge, almost all of these solutions use the Panel's API to function.
            We will be supporting the same API, so everything should work the same.

    <TabItem label="Licensing" value="licensing">
        The Pelican Panel has been relicensed to **AGPLv3**. Wings still uses **MIT**.

        This license change does only affect you if you meet _all_ of the following requirements:
        1. You modified the Pelican panel source files.
        2. These modifications are not open source.
        3. Your modified panel is publicly available. (Note: People who are family, friends, and acquaintances are not the public)

        If you meet _all_ of the above requirements you need a commercial license.
        Please note that the usage or development of plugins/ themes does not require a commercial license.

        You can find more detailed information about the new license in [this blog post](https://pelican.dev/blog/relicensing-pelican-to-agpl).

        <details>
            <summary>Where can I submit feature requests and discuss new ideas?</summary>

            They can be posted on our [Github Discussions](https://github.com/pelican-dev/panel/discussions)
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Are there any hostilities with the previous project?</summary>

            Not at all. We also gave the previous team 2 months of advance notice.
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Why move away to make your own project?</summary>

            Difference of visions, directions, and opinions.
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Couldn't these changes be part of Pterodactyl?</summary>

            If they could, they would. But they can't, so they shan't.
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What will happen with Pterodactyl? Is it EOL now?</summary>

            We can't say that. That's up to the Maintainer of Pterodactyl. Pelican and Pterodactyl are separate projects.

    <TabItem label="Plugins" value="plugins">
        <details>
            <summary>When will the plugin system be available?</summary>

            The plugin system was released with beta30!
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Will pterodactyl addons work with the new system?</summary>

            No. Pterodactyl "addons" are just code modifications. Our codebase now greatly differs from pterodactyls.
            Pelicans plugin system will be a "real" plugin system where plugins don't touch any core files.
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Will blueprint plugins work with the new system?</summary>

            No. And the creator of blueprint won't port blueprint to also support pelican:
            > [I] do not have the capacity to work on multiple Pterodactyl forks [and I] do not believe making an extension framework for a platform promising it's own addon system is worth our time.
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Do I need the commercial license to use or develop plugins?</summary>

            No. Pelicans plugin system will be a "real" plugin system where plugins don't touch any core files.
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Do I need to license my plugins under the same license as pelican?</summary>

            No. You can do whatever you want with your plugins, it's your code.
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What can plugins do?</summary>

            Pretty much anything you want! They can add new pages, change existing ones (to some extent), add new languages, change the theme (color/ font/ css) and more.

            The first iteration _will_ have some limitations but we will continuously improve the capabilities of plugins.
        </details>
