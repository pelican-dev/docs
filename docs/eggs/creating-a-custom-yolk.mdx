# Creating a Custom Yolk

:::warning
This tutorial uses examples from our [`ghcr.io/pelican-eggs/yolks:java_8`](https://github.com/pelican-eggs/yolks) docker image, which can be found on GitHub. This tutorial also assumes some knowledge of [Docker](https://docker.io/), we suggest reading up if this all looks foreign to you.

## Creating the Dockerfile

The most important part of this process is to create the [`Dockerfile`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) that will be used by Wings. Due to heavy restrictions on server containers, you must setup this file in a specific manner.

In the Past we have tred to make use of [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org) as much as possible for our images in order to keep their size down. But for my example we will just use what most eggs are built on, Ubuntu. 

```dockerfile
# ----------------------------------
# Pelican Panel Dockerfile
# Environment: Java
# Minimum Panel Version: 1.0.0
# ----------------------------------
FROM eclipse-temurin:8-jdk-noble

LABEL author="Pelican Panel" maintainer="support@pelican.dev"

RUN apk add --no-cache --update curl ca-certificates openssl git tar bash sqlite fontconfig iproute2 tzdata \
    && adduser --disabled-password --home /home/container container

USER container
ENV  USER=container HOME=/home/container

WORKDIR /home/container

COPY ./entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh

CMD ["/bin/bash", "/entrypoint.sh"]
```

Let's walk through the `Dockerfile` above. The first thing you'll notice is the [`FROM`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from) declaration.

```dockerfile
FROM eclipse-temurin:8-jdk-noble
```

In this case, we are using [`eclipse-temurin:8-jdk-noble`](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build) which provides us with Java 8.

## Installing Dependencies

The next thing we do is install the dependencies we will need using Alpine's package manager: `apk`. You'll notice some specific flags that keep the container small, including `--no-cache`, as well as everything being contained in a single [`RUN`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#run) block.

## Creating a Container User

Within this `RUN` block, you'll notice the `adduser` command.

```bash
adduser --disabled-password --home /home/container container
```

:::warning
All Pelican containers must have a user named `container`, and the user home **must** be `/home/container`.
:::

After we create that user, we then define the default container [`USER`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#user) as well as a few [`ENV`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#env) settings to be applied to things running within the container.

## Work Directory & Entrypoint

One of the last things we do is define a [`WORKDIR`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#workdir) which is where everything else will be executed. The `WORKDIR` must be set to `/home/container`.

Finally, we need to copy our [`ENTRYPOINT`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint) script into the docker image root. This is done using [`COPY`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy), after which we define the command to be used when the container is started using [`CMD`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd). The `CMD` line should always point to the `entrypoint.sh` file.

```dockerfile
COPY ./entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
CMD ["/bin/bash", "/entrypoint.sh"]
```

## Entrypoint Script

In order to complete this `Dockerfile`, we will need an `entrypoint.sh` file which tells Docker how to run this specific server type.

These entrypoint files are actually fairly abstracted, and Wings will pass in the start command as an environment variable before processing it and then executing the command.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /home/container

# Output Current Java Version
java -version ## only really needed to show what version is being used. Should be changed for different applications

# Replace Startup Variables
MODIFIED_STARTUP=`eval echo $(echo ${STARTUP} | sed -e 's/{{/${/g' -e 's/}}/}/g')`
echo ":/home/container$ ${MODIFIED_STARTUP}"

# Run the Server
${MODIFIED_STARTUP}
```

The second command, `cd /home/container`, simply ensures we are in the correct directory when running the rest of the commands. We then follow that up with `java -version` to output this information to end-users, but that is not necessary.

## Modifying the Startup Command

The most significant part of this file is the `MODIFIED_STARTUP` environment variable. What we are doing in this case is parsing the environment `STARTUP` that is passed into the container by Wings. In most cases, this variable looks something like the example below:

```bash
STARTUP="java -Xms128M -Xmx{{SERVER_MEMORY}}M -jar {{SERVER_JARFILE}}"
```

You'll notice some placeholders there, specifically `{{SERVER_MEMORY}}` and `{{SERVER_JARFILE}}`. These both refer to other environment variables being passed in, and they look something like the example below.

```bash
SERVER_MEMORY=1024
SERVER_JARFILE=server.jar
```

There are a host of different environment variables, and they change depending on the specific egg configuration. However, that is not necessarily anything to worry about here.

```bash
MODIFIED_STARTUP=`eval echo $(echo ${STARTUP} | sed -e 's/{{/${/g' -e 's/}}/}/g')`
```

The command above simply evaluates the `STARTUP` environment variable, and then replaces anything surrounded in curly braces `{{EXAMPLE}}` with a matching environment variable (such as `EXAMPLE`). Thus, our `STARTUP` command:

```bash
java -Xms128M -Xmx{{SERVER_MEMORY}}M -jar {{SERVER_JARFILE}}
```

Becomes:

```bash
java -Xms128M -Xmx1024M -jar server.jar
```

## Run the Command

The last step is to run this modified startup command, which is done with the line `${MODIFIED_STARTUP}`.

## Note

Sometimes you may need to change the permissions of the `entrypoint.sh` file. On Linux you can do this by executing `chmod +x entrypoint.sh` in the directory where the file is located.
