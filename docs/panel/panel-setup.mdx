# Panel Setup

The core environment is easily configured using a single CLI command & the web installer built into the app.

This step will cover setting up things such as sessions, caching, database credentials, and email sending.

Running `php artisan p:environment:setup` will, if it does not exist, auto create the required `.env` file and generate a `APP_KEY`.

<Admonition type="info" title="Want to use MySQL/ MariaDB?">
    Make sure to read the [MySQL guide](./advanced/mysql) first if you want to use MySQL/ MariaDB instead of SQLite!
</Admonition>

```sh
php artisan p:environment:setup
```

<Admonition type="warning" title="BACK UP APP_KEY!">
    **Back up** your encryption key (APP_KEY in the `.env` file). This is used as an encryption key for all data that needs to be stored securely (e.g. api keys).
    Store it somewhere safe - not just on your server. If you lose it all encrypted data is irrecoverable -- **even if you have database backups.**
</Admonition>

### Setting Permissions

The next stop in the installation process is to set the correct permissions on the Panel files so that the webserver can
use them correctly.

```sh
chmod -R 755 storage/* bootstrap/cache/
```

<Tabs groupId="webserver">
    <TabItem value='NGINX/Apache'>
        ```sh
        chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/pelican
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='Rocky Linux NGINX'>
        ```sh
        chown -R nginx:nginx /var/www/pelican
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='Rocky Linux Apache'>
        ```sh
        chown -R apache:apache /var/www/pelican
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Crontab Configuration

We need to create a new cronjob that runs every minute to process specific tasks, such as session cleanup and scheduled tasks.
You'll want to open your crontab.

<Tabs groupId="webserver">
    <TabItem value='NGINX/Apache'>
        ```sh
        sudo crontab -e -u www-data
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='Rocky Linux NGINX'>
        ```sh
        sudo crontab -e -u nginx
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='Rocky Linux Apache'>
        ```sh
        sudo crontab -e -u apache
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

And then paste the line below.

```sh
* * * * * php /var/www/pelican/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

### Setting up Queue Service

Once you install the panel and set up the cron-tab the last step to take is to set up the queue service. This can be
done with the command below.

```sh
sudo php artisan p:environment:queue-service
```

### Database Setup

Now we need to setup all of the base data for the Panel in the database you created earlier. The command below may take some time to run depending on your machine. Please DO NOT exit the process until it is completed! This command will setup the database tables and then add all of the Nests & Eggs that power Pelican.

```sh
php artisan migrate --seed --force
```

### Web-Installer

Once you've set the proper permissions & created the Cron & Queue worker, continue the Panel install on the web interface.
