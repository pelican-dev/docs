# Updating the Panel

This documentation covers the process for updating the panel portion of Pelican.

## Version Requirements

Each version of Pelican Panel also has a corresponding minimum version of Wings that
is required for it to run.  

Please see the chart below for how these versions line up. In
most cases your base Wings version should match that of your Panel.

| Panel Version | Wings Version  | Supported | PHP Version  |
| :-----------: | :------------: | :-------: | :----------: |
| 3.x           | 3.x            | ✅︎        | 8.2/ 8.3     |

### Enter Maintenance Mode

Whenever you are performing an update you should be sure to place your Panel into maintenance mode. This will prevent
users from encountering unexpected errors.

```sh
cd /var/www/pelican
php artisan down
```

### Download Update

The first step in the update process is to download the new panel files from GitHub. The command below will download
the release archive for the most recent version of Pelican, save it in the current directory and will automatically
unpack the archive into your current folder.

```sh
curl -L https://github.com/pelican-dev/panel/releases/latest/download/panel.tar.gz | sudo tar -xzv
```

Once the zip is downloaded and extracted we need to set the correct permissions on the cache and storage directories to avoid
any webserver related errors.

```sh
chmod -R 755 storage/* bootstrap/cache
```

### Update Dependencies


```sh
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

### Clear Compiled Template Cache

You'll also want to clear the compiled template cache to ensure that new and modified templates show up correctly for
users.

```sh
php artisan view:clear
php artisan config:clear
```

### Update Database
You'll also need to update your database schema. Running the command below
will update the schema and ensure the default eggs we ship are up to date (and add any new ones we might have). Just
remember, _never edit core eggs we ship_! They will be overwritten by this update process.

```sh
php artisan migrate --seed --force
```

### Set Permissions

The last step is to set proper ownership of the files. In most cases this
is `www-data` but can vary from system to system &mdash; sometimes being `nginx`, `caddy`, `apache`, or even `nobody`.

<Tabs className="unique-tabs">
    <TabItem value="NGINX/Apache">
        ```sh
        chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/pelican/* 
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Rocky Linux NGINX">
        ```sh 
        chown -R nginx:nginx /var/www/pelican/* 
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Rocky Linux Apache">
        ```sh 
        chown -R apache:apache /var/www/pelican/* 
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
### Restart Queue Workers

After _every update_ you should restart the queue worker.

```sh
php artisan queue:restart
```

### Exit Maintenance Mode

Now that everything has been updated you need to exit maintenance mode.

```sh
php artisan up
```
