# Updating the Panel

This documentation covers the process for updating the panel portion of Pelican.

## Version Requirements

Each version of Pelican Panel also has a corresponding minimum version of Wings that
is required for it to run.

Please see the chart below for how these versions line up. In
most cases your base Wings version should match that of your Panel.

| Panel Version | Wings Version  | Supported | PHP Version  |
| :-----------: | :------------: | :-------: | :----------: |
| 1.x           | 1.x            | ✅︎        | 8.2/ 8.3     |

### Enter Maintenance Mode

Whenever you are performing an update you should be sure to place your Panel into maintenance mode. This will prevent
users from encountering unexpected errors.

```sh
cd /var/www/pelican
php artisan down
```

<Admonition type="warning">
   If you are updating from < 1.0.0-beta13. Please use the below script! This will ensure all the recently deleted files are removed.

Note: this script is experimental... IT WILL NOT CREATE A MYSQL DUMP FOR YOUR DATABASE!
Note Note: This script runs all the below commands for you. 

What the script does, is looks for `.env`, and if it exists pulls `DB_CONNECTION` to see if you are using mysql/mariadb/sqlite, if sqlite it will copy the database.sqlite to a backup folder
along with the env. Once they're copied to the backup folder it will delete everything except the backup folder in the specified install directory. 

Proceeds to download the latest release, extracts to install directory, Sets some permissions, runs composer install, restores old sqlite database and .env. Runs Filament Optimize, Updates migrations, asks you to input the webserver for file owner (www-data/apache/nginx), restarts the queue, and Voilà! If you have any issues please reach out on discord!

If you do not wish to use the script and wish to do it manually, You can delete everything except the `.env` and the sqlite database file, if using sqlite. then follow the standard update process below. 

```sh
sudo bash <(curl -s https://pelican.dev/updatePanel.sh)
```

### Download Update

The first step in the update process is to download the new panel files from GitHub. The command below will download
the release archive for the most recent version of Pelican, save it in the current directory and will automatically
unpack the archive into your current folder.

```sh
curl -L https://github.com/pelican-dev/panel/releases/latest/download/panel.tar.gz | sudo tar -xzv
```

Once the archive is downloaded and extracted we need to set the correct permissions on the cache and storage directories to avoid
any webserver related errors.

```sh
sudo chmod -R 755 storage/* bootstrap/cache
```

### Update Dependencies

```sh
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

<Admonition type="info">
    Even though composer might tell you that you have outdated dependencies, do **not** run `composer update`!
</Admonition>

### Clear Compiled Template Cache

You'll also want to clear the compiled template cache to ensure that new and modified templates show up correctly for
users.

```sh
php artisan view:clear
php artisan config:clear
```

## Cache components

To make sure your panel loads faster you'll want to cache filament components.

```sh
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan filament:optimize
```

### Update Database

You'll also need to update your database schema. Running the command below
will update the schema and ensure the default eggs we ship are up to date (and add any new ones we might have). Just
remember, _never edit core eggs we ship_! They will be overwritten by this update process.

```sh
php artisan migrate --seed --force
```

### Set Permissions

The last step is to set proper ownership of the files. In most cases this
is `www-data` but can vary from system to system &mdash; sometimes being `nginx`, `caddy`, `apache`, or even `nobody`.

<Tabs className="unique-tabs">
    <TabItem value="NGINX/Apache">
        ```sh
        sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/pelican
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Rocky Linux NGINX">
        ```sh
        sudo chown -R nginx:nginx /var/www/pelican
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Rocky Linux Apache">
        ```sh
        sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/pelican
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Restart Queue Workers

After _every update_ you should restart the queue worker.

```sh
php artisan queue:restart
```

### Exit Maintenance Mode

Now that everything has been updated you need to exit maintenance mode.

```sh
php artisan up
```
