# Updating the Panel

This documentation covers the process for updating the panel portion of Pelican.

## Version Requirements

Each version of Pelican Panel also has a corresponding minimum version of Wings that is required for it to run.

Please see the chart below for how these versions line up.

| Panel Version | Wings Version | Supported | PHP Version     |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:---------:|:---------------:|
|      1.x      |      1.x      |    ✅︎     | 8.2/8.3/8.4/8.5 |

## Updating

You have two options for updating: use the automatic update script (recommended) or do the update steps manually.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="Update script (recommended)">
        Simply run the command below and the update script will guide you through the process:

        ```sh
        sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://pelican.dev/updatePanel.sh)"
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Manual update">
        ### Enter Maintenance Mode

        Whenever you are performing an update you should be sure to place your Panel into maintenance mode. This will prevent
        users from encountering unexpected errors.

        ```sh
        cd /var/www/pelican
        sudo php artisan down
        ```

        ### Download Update

        The first step in the update process is to download the new panel files from GitHub. The command below will download
        the release archive for the most recent version of Pelican, save it in the current directory and will automatically
        unpack the archive into your current folder.

        ```sh
        curl -L https://github.com/pelican-dev/panel/releases/latest/download/panel.tar.gz | sudo tar -xzv
        ```

        Once the archive is downloaded and extracted we need to set the correct permissions on the cache and storage directories to avoid
        any webserver related errors.

        ```sh
        sudo chmod -R 755 storage/* bootstrap/cache
        ```

        ### Update Dependencies

        ```sh
        sudo COMPOSER_ALLOW_SUPERUSER=1 composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
        ```

        <Admonition type="info">
            Even though composer might tell you that you have outdated dependencies, do **not** run `composer update`!
        </Admonition>

        ### Create storage symlinks

        ```sh
        sudo php artisan storage:link
        ```

        ## Cache components

        ```sh
        sudo php artisan optimize:clear
        sudo php artisan filament:optimize
        ```

        ### Update Database

        You'll also need to update your database schema. Running the command below
        will update the schema and ensure the default eggs we ship are up to date (and add any new ones we might have). Just
        remember, _never edit core eggs we ship_! They will be overwritten by this update process.

        ```sh
        sudo php artisan migrate --seed --force
        ```

        ### Set Permissions

        The last step is to set proper ownership of the files. In most cases this
        is `www-data` but can vary from system to system &mdash; sometimes being `nginx`, `caddy`, `apache`, or even `nobody`.

        <Tabs>
            <TabItem value="NGINX/ Apache/ Caddy">
                ```sh
                sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/pelican
                ```
            </TabItem>
            <TabItem value="Rocky Linux NGINX">
                ```sh
                sudo chown -R nginx:nginx /var/www/pelican
                ```
            </TabItem>
            <TabItem value="Rocky Linux Apache">
                ```sh
                sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/pelican
                ```
            </TabItem>
        </Tabs>

        ### Restart Queue Workers

        After _every update_ you should restart the queue worker.

        ```sh
        sudo php artisan queue:restart
        ```

        ### Exit Maintenance Mode

        Now that everything has been updated you need to exit maintenance mode.

        ```sh
        sudo php artisan up
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Themes

If you previously had any themes installed you need to manually build the panel assets again.
Run the following commands inside your panel directory (`/var/www/pelican` by default):

```sh
yarn install
yarn build

php artisan view:clear
```
