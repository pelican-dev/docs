# Redis

## Install Redis

To install Redis you first need add their repository.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://packages.redis.io/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/redis-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/redis-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.redis.io/deb $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/redis.list
```

Now you can install Redis by simply running the following commands.

```sh
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y redis-server
```

Also make sure to enable that redis will start on boot. You can do that by running the following command:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now redis-server
```

## Setup Pelican for Redis

### Use Redis as driver

If you are switching to Redis after installing the Panel you have to run the setup command below.  
**You do not have to run this if this is the first time you are installing the Panel. You will provide the database data via the Web Installer.**

```sh
cd /var/www/pelican
php artisan p:redis:setup
```
