### MySQL Setup


#### Logging In
The first step in this process is to login to the MySQL command line where we will be executing statements to get
things setup. To do so, simply run the command below and provide the Root MySQL account's password that you setup when
installing MySQL. If you do not remember doing this, chances are you can just hit enter as no password is set.

```sh
mysql -u root -p
```

#### Creating User
Next, we will create a user called `pelican` and allow logins from localhost which prevents any external connections
to our database. You can also use `%` as a wildcard or enter a numeric IP. We will also set the account password
to `somePassword`.

```sql
CREATE USER 'pelican'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'somePassword';
```

#### Creating Database
Next, we need to create a database for the panel. In this tutorial we will be naming the database `panel`, but you can
substitute that for whatever name you wish.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE panel;
```

#### Assigning Permissions
Finally, we need to tell MySQL that our pelican user should have access to the panel database. To do this, simply
run the command below.

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON panel.* TO 'pelican'@'127.0.0.1';
```
