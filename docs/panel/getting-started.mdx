# Getting Started

Pelican Panel is designed to run on your webserver.

You are expected to read through our documentation.
We have spent a lot of time curating these docs for the community,
so please take some time to read through them before asking for help on the forums!

<Admonition type="danger">
    **You should have some basic familiarity with Linux before you proceed!**
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="warning">
    Pelican is currently in **Beta**! Some things might change / break between beta versions!
</Admonition>

### Picking an Operating System (OS)

Pelican runs on a wide range of operating systems, so pick whichever you are most comfortable using. Note: Other OS's, not listed below, might still work.

<Admonition type="warning">
    OpenVZ, **unless specifically configured**, will **not** work with Pelican.
</Admonition>

| Operating System | Version | Supported | Notes                                                                 |
|:----------------:|:-------:|:---------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| **Ubuntu**       | 20.04   |     ⚠️︎    | **No SQLite Support**, Ubuntu 20.04 EoL is April 2025, not recommended|
|                  | 22.04   |     ✅︎  |                                                                       |
|                  |**24.04**|     ✅︎  | Documentation written assuming Ubuntu 24.04 as the base OS.           |
| **Rocky Linux**  | 9       |     ✅︎  |                                                                       |
| **Debian**       | 11      |     ⚠️    | **No SQLite Support**                                                 |
|                  | 12      |     ✅︎  |                                                                       |

SQLite support depends on [libsqlite3-0_3.35+](https://pkgs.org/download/libsqlite3-0) being on the host system.
Ubuntu 20.04 & Debian 11 do not meet this requirement.

### Dependencies
<Admonition type="warning">
    The `ondrej/php` repository is required to install the latest versions of PHP and its required extensions.

    It can be added with the following command.
    ```sh
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
    ```
</Admonition>

* PHP `8.3` (recommended) or `8.2` with the following extensions: `gd`, `mysql`, `mbstring`, `bcmath`, `xml`, `curl`, `zip`, `intl`, `sqlite3` and `fpm`
* MySQL `8` (`mysql-server`) **or** MariaDB `10.3`+
* A webserver (Apache, NGINX, Caddy, etc.)
* `curl`
* `tar`
* `composer` v2

### Installing Composer

Composer is a dependency manager for PHP, You'll need composer installed before continuing in this guide.

``` bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
```


### Create Directories & Downloading Files

The first step in this process is to create the folder where the panel will live and then move ourselves into that
newly created folder.

```sh
mkdir -p /var/www/pelican
cd /var/www/pelican
```

Once you have created a new directory to use and moved into it you'll need to download the Panel files. This
is as simple as using `curl` to download the latest release.
```sh
curl -Lo panel.tar.gz https://github.com/pelican-dev/panel/releases/latest/download/panel.tar.gz
```
Once it is downloaded you'll need to unpack the archive and then set the correct permissions on the `storage/` and `bootstrap/cache/` directories.

```sh
tar -xzvf panel.tar.gz
chmod -R 755 storage/* bootstrap/cache/
```

### Installation

Next we will set up the default environment settings file, dependencies, and then generate a new application encryption key.

```sh
sudo composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

### Environment Configuration

The core environment is easily configured using a few different CLI commands built into the app. This step
will cover setting up things such as sessions, caching, database credentials, and email sending.

Running `php artisan p:environment:setup` will, if it does not exist, auto create the required `.env` file and generate a `APP_KEY`.

<Admonition type="info">
    Make sure to read the [MySQL guide](./advanced/mysql) first if you want to use MySQL instead of SQLite!
</Admonition>

```sh
php artisan p:environment:setup
```
```sh
php artisan p:environment:database
```
### Setting up Mail - Optional

If you'd like to set up the panel to send emails for newly created servers to users & password resets. Use this command.

```sh
php artisan p:environment:mail
```
<Admonition type="warning">
    **Back up** your encryption key (APP_KEY in the `.env` file). This is used as an encryption key for all data that needs to be stored securely (e.g. api keys).
    Store it somewhere safe - not just on your server. If you lose it all encrypted data is irrecoverable -- **even if you have database backups.**
</Admonition>

### Database Initialization

Now we need to set up database for the Panel that you created before.
**The command below may take some time to run depending on your machine.
Please _DO NOT_ exit the process until it is completed!**

```sh
php artisan migrate --seed --force
```

### Creating User

You'll then need to create an administrative user so that you can log into the panel. To do so, run the command below.

Passwords **must** meet the following requirements: 8 characters, mixed case, at least one number.

```sh
php artisan p:user:make
```

### Crontab Configuration

We need to create a new cronjob that runs every minute to process specific tasks, such as session cleanup and scheduled tasks.
You'll want to open your crontab.

<Tabs groupId="webserver">
    <TabItem value='NGINX/Apache'>
        ```sh
        sudo crontab -e -u www-data
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='Rocky Linux NGINX'>
        ```sh
        sudo crontab -e -u nginx
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='Rocky Linux Apache'>
        ```sh
        sudo crontab -e -u apache
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

And then paste the line below.

```sh
* * * * * php /var/www/pelican/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

### Setting Permissions

The last step in the installation process is to set the correct permissions on the Panel files so that the webserver can
use them correctly.

<Tabs groupId="webserver">
    <TabItem value='NGINX/Apache'>
        ```sh
        chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/pelican
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='Rocky Linux NGINX'>
        ```sh
        chown -R nginx:nginx /var/www/pelican
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='Rocky Linux Apache'>
        ```sh
        chown -R apache:apache /var/www/pelican
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
