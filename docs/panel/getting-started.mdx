# Getting Started

Pelican Panel is designed to run on your webserver.

You are expected to read through our documentation.
We have spent a lot of time curating these docs for the community,
so please take some time to read through them before asking for help on the forums!

    **You should have some basic familiarity with Linux before you proceed!**

    Pelican is currently in **Beta**! Some things might change / break between beta versions!

### Picking an Operating System (OS)

Pelican runs on a wide range of operating systems, so pick whichever you are most comfortable using. Note: Other OS's, not listed below, might still work.

<Admonition type="warning">
    OpenVZ, **unless specifically configured**, will **not** work with Pelican.

SQLite support depends on [libsqlite3-0_3.35+](https://pkgs.org/download/libsqlite3-0) being on the host system.
**No SQLite Support** means you'll have to build the package from source.

### Dependencies

For the Panel you need to install **PHP `8.5` (recommended), `8.4`, `8.3` or `8.2`**, with the following **extensions**:  
`gd`, `mysql`, `mbstring`, `bcmath`, `xml`, `curl`, `zip`, `intl`, `sqlite3` and `fpm`.

You will also need a Webserver. Currently, **Apache, NGINX or Caddy** are supported.

If you want to use MySQL or MariaDB for the panel database make sure to install either **MySQL 8+ or MariaDB 10.6+**. (both client and server!)

Finally, for some commands during the installation you need `curl`, `tar` and `unzip`.

<Admonition type="warning">
    Please make sure you installed **all** needed dependencies before continuing!

### Create Directories & Downloading Files

The first step in this process is to create the folder where the panel will live and then move ourselves into that
newly created folder.

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/pelican
cd /var/www/pelican
```

Once you have created a new directory to use and moved into it, you'll need to download the Panel files.
This is as simple as using `curl` to download the latest release.

```sh
curl -L https://github.com/pelican-dev/panel/releases/latest/download/panel.tar.gz | sudo tar -xzv
```

### Install Composer

Next we will set up Composer along with the required dependencies.

``` bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
```

```sh
sudo COMPOSER_ALLOW_SUPERUSER=1 composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

<Admonition type="info">
    Even though composer might tell you that you have outdated dependencies, do **not** run `composer update`!
