# About Quotas

<Admonition type="tip">
    As called out in the Wings install docs, it is always recommended to keep the server files on a separate partition.  
</Admonition>

## There are a lot of notices here for a reason!

<Admonition type="danger">
    Support for disk quotas is still being worked on!
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="warning">
    These are advanced configurations meant for hosts but "should" work for individuals as well.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="warning">
    Depending on the filesystem Quotas can be difficult to enable for the `/` mount, which requires booting a live disk to change.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info">
    You can either make a new mount with quotas enabled or enable quotas on an existing partition.
</Admonition>
