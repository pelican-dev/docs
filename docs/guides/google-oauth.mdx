# Setting up Google OAuth login.

This guide will help you with setting up Google OAuth on your panel.

# Creating OAuth client ID and secret on Google Cloud.

First, you need to generate the authentication for the OAuth.

1. Go to [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a project, pick a name you can remember so if you need to generate credentials again you know where it's at.
2. Go to **API's and services** and select credentials.
3. On the top of the window click **Create credentials** and then **OAuth client ID**.
4. Select the **Application Type** and select **Web Application**.
5. On the bottom of the page add a redirection URI: https://yourpanel.com/auth/oauth/callback/google
6. Click on save at the bottom and don't close the popup, it contains your client ID and client Secret.
7. Go to your Pelican admin panel > Settings > OAuth > Google > Enable.
8. Put your Client ID we created earlier in Client ID and your Client secret in Client secret.
9. Save your changes.
Enjoy!
