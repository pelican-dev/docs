# Setting Up Google OAuth

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up Google OAuth on your panel.

## Creating an OAuth Client ID and Secret in Google Cloud

First, you need to generate OAuth authentication credentials.

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project. Choose a memorable name so you can easily find it if you need to manage credentials later.
2. Navigate to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**.
3. At the top of the page, click **Create Credentials** and select **OAuth client ID**.
4. For **Application Type**, choose **Web Application**.
5. Under **Authorized Redirect URIs**, add: `https://yourpanel.com/auth/oauth/callback/google`
6. Click **Save**. A popup will appear containing your Client ID and Client Secret â€” keep this window open as you will need this information shortly.
7. In your Pelican admin panel, go to **Settings** > **OAuth** > **Google**, and enable Google OAuth.
8. Enter the Client ID and Client Secret you generated earlier.
9. Save your changes.

You're all set!

## Troubleshooting

### Error 400

Ensure that the redirect URI you entered in Google Cloud matches exactly with `https://yourpanel.com/auth/oauth/callback/google`.
