## Dear Community,

Today, we are thrilled to share with you an exciting new beginning.
We are embarking on a new journey — one that leads us to the creation of Pelican Panel.
Our vision is to build on top of the foundation we've had the privilege of being a part of previously,
while also exploring new horizons and introducing features that we believe will greatly benefit the community.

In the coming months, we are excited to roll out several updates that we think you'll really look forward to, including:

* **Install Plugins**: ability to create, edit, upload plugins (just as easy as eggs)
* **Easier Installation**: greatly streamlining the usage and setup
* **Better Code**: improving and simplifying the code base to encourage open source contributions
* **Accepting Suggestions**: we are accepting new feature suggestions and voting for them
* **Active Discord**: panel integrations with discord (and steam) for logins and role/permissions sync
* **GitHub Bounties**: ability to receive and pay for and fund github issues
* **Central Hub**: our marketplace for trusted plugins and services (eggs)

We understand that change can be daunting and may lead to questions.
We want to assure you that we are here to listen and address any concerns you may have.
Our door is always open for feedback, suggestions, or any thoughts you wish to share.
We are just beginning and excited about what the future holds.
We invite you to join us on this new adventure, to continue the collaboration, innovation, and community spirit that has always been at the heart of our efforts.

Thank you for your continued support and trust.
Here's to new beginnings, and to a future filled with great new possibilities!

Best regards,
